# Website

In this repository, you will find my practical web development projects and exercises. Here I apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build functional websites with clean design, basic validations, and exercises that strengthen logic and code structure. It's a showcase of my learning process, coding style, and progress in web development.
