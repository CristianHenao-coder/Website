It asks the user for their name and age.
It validates that:
The name is not empty or just spaces.
The age is a valid number between 1 and 100.
It displays the data using:
An object (with id, name, age).
A Set to prevent duplicates.
A Map to assign a category (Young or Adult).
It shows all the information on screen with a simple visual design.

# Project Files
index.htm → Contains the structure of the page. (If the .L in .html is missing, it's because my computer doesn’t open .html files unless I remove the L.)
Style.css → Visual style similar to the provided example.
Scripts.js → Program logic and validations.

Open the index.html file in your browser.
